<Meta title="Content Structure" />

Content at Lightstep can take many different forms to serve different audiences. Because they are all delivered over the web, and to enhance our branding, they all use the same basic structure. 

Read this guideline to understand the different content types at Lightstep and the components used in our content.

## Content types

### Product UI text (micro-content)	
**Description**
UI text is the content (descriptions, help text, and so on) displayed in our [web app](https://app.lightstep.com).

**Owner(s)**
The design team creates the text when they design the page.<br>
PM, Marketing, Eng, and Docs all help to refine the final copy

**Audience**
Anyone using the Lightstep app. Most helpful to new users.

**Guidelines**
UI Text helps users understand what they're looking at on a page, but they will ignore a wall of text.
* Be as concise as possible
* Use a friendly, but confident tone
* Use present tense
    * Yes: The Instrumentation Quality score checks for these attribute keys...
    * No: The Instrumentation Quality score will check for these attribute keys...

### Blog posts	
**Description**
Blog posts live on our [website](https://lightstep.com/blog) and are an informal way for us to inform and educate our customers. Unlike product docs, they can show our personalities, entertain, and are rarely updated to match our latest release.

**Owner(s)**
Marketing - but anyone in the company can create a blog post.

**Audience**
Anyone visiting the Lightstep website or redirected directly from a social post or other website. 

**Guidelines**
<p style="color:red;">Do we have stds for blog posts?</p>

### Product doc topics
**Description**	
Product docs live in our [Learning Portal](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/) and are the "official" documentation for our product. Unlike blog posts, they must be updated when the product changes or adds new features. 

**Owner(s)**
Product Docs

**Audience**
Customers and potential customers wanting to learn how to use Lightstep. 

**Guidelines**
Legally, the *can* serve as a contract for what the product does, so above all else, they must be factual.
* Non-emotional, but they must consider the emotions of the user. 
* Concise, explanatory, and complete. Consider all angles/questions that the user might have.
* Refrain from using "we" (use "you" whenever possible) and other tutorial type tone.


### Learning paths	
**Description**	
Learning paths also live in our [Learning Portal](https://docs.lightstep.com/paths/) and are tutorials that combine and extend the product docs. While the product docs tend to be feature-based, learning paths strive to combine features to mimic real-world use cases. 

**Owner(s)**
Product Docs

**Audience**
Customers and potential customers wanting to extend their Lightstep knowledge or prefer tutorials as a way to learn. 

**Guidelines**
Learning paths are much less formal than product docs.
* The tone is more enthusiastic and supportive. 
* Use "we" and other tutorial-type verbiage.
* Short in duration and complexity to reduce fallout.


### Early access docs	
**Description**	
Early access docs are for our CA (controlled availability) customers when the content must be password-protected (most CA content is _not_ early-access). 

**Owner(s)**
Product Docs

**Audience**
Customers participating in a controlled release. 

**Guidelines**
Early access content can be considered "beta" as it is often not complete or final. They follow the same guidelines as product docs, except:
* Screenshots and procedural content can be out-of-date if expected to change multiple times during the CA period 
* Content does not need to be as polished, but should be kept as correct as possible.

### OTel docs	
**Description**	
OTel docs are similar to product docs, but specifically about using OpenTelemetry and are not necessarily Lightstep specific. 

**Owner(s)**
DevRel

**Audience**
Developers looking to use OpenTelemetry and not necessarily wanting to use Lightstep to consume the telemetry data.

**Guidelines**
While OTel docs are vendor-neutral, they do promote Lightstep where they can and must maintain the Lightstep brand and enhance our SEO for the OpenTelemetry space. They have the same guidelines as product docs, plus:
* Should use Lightstep in all examples for consuming telemetry data.
* Use an authoritative tone to reflect Lightstep's expertise in this area.

### Email
*Description**	
Lightstep regularly sends emails for customer and prospective outreach.

**Owner(s)**
Marketing and Customer Success

**Audience**
Prospective, new, and existing customers

**Guidelines**
<p style="color:red;">This is from the old style guide. Still accurate?</p>
*   Personalize emails with meaningful content for high-value targets
*   Provide a way to opt out of future emails
*   Be persistent but donâ€™t be overly pushy
*   Be brief and to the point
*   Use a conversational tone


### Social media
**Descriptiton**	
Lightstep focuses on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LightstepHQ) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lightstep/) for our social posts.

**Owner(s)**
Marketing, but any employee can post/re-post to their own accounts

**Audience**
DevOps and anyone interested in Observability, as well as existing customers

**Guidelines**
<p style="color:red;">Do we have existing guidelines?</p>
